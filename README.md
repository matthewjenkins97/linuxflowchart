# English Translation
This has been translated to English by matthewjenkins97, using Google Translate. Some of the jokes and some of the slang in the original did not translate well to an English audience, but aside from that it's a very usable flowchart. Hell, I've used it to decide my Linux distro (Fedora, by the way).
